To do:
* ~~create final .yml file for the environment we used~~
* ~~have folder for text methods and another for graph methods~~
* ~~have one script for complete pipeline~~
* handle the unbalanced-ness of the data
* when cross-validating, make sure the folds are "even" in the sense that they are
equally inbalanced
* graph loss while training
* Use statistical approaches to verify that our features are important (p test)
* use Chi-Sq from assessment on data given to improve predictions?
* Add DBSCAN to features folder
